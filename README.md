## Overview
This template provides a framework for building and evaluating classification models using Python's `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation.
## Features
- Load and preprocess data
- Handle missing values
- Train various classification models
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
## Installation
To use this template, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn.
```

## Usage
Load your dataset: Modify the section of the code where the dataset is loaded to point to your data file.
Preprocess the data: Ensure any necessary preprocessing steps are applied (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).
Train a model: Choose the classification model you wish to use by modifying the relevant section of the code.
Evaluate the model: Cross-validate and evaluate the model performance using the provided metrics.

## Model Evaluation
The template includes code for evaluating model performance using cross-validation. Adjust the parameters as needed to fit your specific use case.
